As the number of credit card transactions keeps growing and represents an increasing share of the 
European payment system. Leading to several stolen account numbers and subsequent losses to banks, 
also people believed that credit card transaction fraud is a growing threat with severe implications for 
the financial industry. Data mining plays a crucial role in detecting credit card fraud in both online and 
offline transactions. Credit card fraud detection which is a data mining problem becomes challenging 
for two main reasons. First, the characteristics of normal and fraudulent behavior are continually 
changing, and second, the credit card fraud dataset is highly asymmetric. The performance of fraud 
detection in credit card transactions is greatly affected by the sampling method of the dataset and the 
choice of variables and the detection techniques used. This paper investigates the performance of 
logistic regression (LR), k-nearest-neighbor (KNN), naive bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree (DT) 
and on credit card fraud data. The dataset of credit card transactions obtained from European cardholders 
contains 284,807 transactions. A mixture of under-sampling and over-sampling techniques applied to 
the unbalanced data. The five strategies were used to the raw and pre- processed data, respectively. 
This work is implemented in Python. The performance of the methods was evaluated based on accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, precision and recall rate. The results are shown in comparison. After cross
validation, the accuracy of the best classification algorithm model in, k nearest neighbor, na√Øve bayes, 
Random Forest, logistic regression and is 97.92% which using the over-sampling model.
